# Orientation-Project-
I am creating a .py file using tkinter and basic logic to create a simple interface so that freshers of my college can come to know the number of clubs in the college and join them ASAP.
I am a computer science student from Amity University Rajasthan and new to the world of GitHub.
Here I am to create a project , typically using python . 
About: I want to create a simple application where we take the general details of fresher students of college and provide them basic details of all the clubs societites of the college.
This will help them deciding which club to join and what are the basic clubs of our college !
This will also be beneficial to the clubs as they will get a full team in advance and compete in the intercollege fests !
I will be obliged for any kind of help I receive !
